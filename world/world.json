The lower part of the hut was built from stones found nearby, worked on by stone masons on site and carefully laid to form the bottom walls. Above this, wooden walls were built, constructed from large planks carried up one at a time by groups of four or more climbers, an incredible effort, and one which cost the lives of two climbers who slipped and fell to their deaths. With high winds constantly threatening the structure, efforts were made to further secure it by tying the walls of the structure to anchors embedded in the mountain with thick ropes. Laid out similarly to the Carroll Hut, four three-level bunk beds line the side walls, and a cast iron stove provides heat. A food and drink storage area sits just below the floor of the hut, accessible by opening a wooden hatch built into the floor, and this area remains cold year round due to permafrost just below the surface.",
